If the SPK file you are trying to use is in the old format, then u must first convert it

Convertion, ./spkconvert <oldfile.spk> <newfile.spk>

running ./spktool will display the list of options available.
using it with just the switch, ie ./spktool -v.  It will display the syntax and usage for the command.

SPKTool can be used to view contents of files, extract the archive, create a new one, add and remove files from the arhive.
